# cc2ndproject
My second project with CodeClan, this time in a group. Tinder, but with the goal of adopting animals from a shelter.


## Before you start

Open the server folder in the Terminal. There, type either "npm install" or "npm update" and wait for the dependencies to finish installing. From there, 
type "npm run seeds" to populate the app with data. Once that's completed, type "npm run server:dev" to get the server up and running. 

Open the client folder in a **second** Terminal window. Type "npm install/update" as before. Once complete, "npm start". Your browser should automatically run ***furFinder***.

### Features

- infinite scrolling between pet cards
- popup adoption request forms
- add, update, delete animals and mark them as adopted from admin side
- archive adoption requests from admin side
- lots of cutie kitties and puppies ^_^
